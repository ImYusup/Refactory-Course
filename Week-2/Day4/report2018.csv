,An analyst is trying to devise a regression model to predict the P/E ratio of the S$P index
,The model might include a number of quantitative independent variables such as interest
,rates and qualitative variable such as the "investor psychology" 

,The analyst could represent the investor psychology by 0 (low) or 1 (high)

,In general, a qualitative variable that can take q different distinct values can be represented by q-1 dummy variables.
,In the example, the qualitative variable could take two distinct values (high or low) thus we were able 
,to incorporate this information with only one dummy variable (investor).

,Suppose in another example we are trying to see if there is a seasonal pattern to the dependent variable. To represent the 
,impact of the four quarters we would use three dummy variable:
,    ,D1,1 if the quarter is I, 0 otherwise
,,D2,1 if the quarter is II, 0 otherwise
,,D3,1 if the quarter is III, 0 otherwise. 
,,,Notice that if all of D1, D2 and D3 are all zero, the quarter must be IV, thus no need to introduce
,,,a new variable for quarter IV. 

,,In this coding schema of the quarters quarter IV is called the base
,,Designation of any one of the qualitative values as base is completely arbitrary, we could have just as 
,,easily designated quarter I, II, or III as the base.
